## Introduction
This mobile app is the final product of the FPT University's capstone project, made by our 5 wonderful people. It can work on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Use cases
This app has 37 use cases. Here are some core functionalities of the app:
- Authentication: The student has a valid student code and email provided by FPT University, then has to go through the e-KYC process (capture identity card and facial feature) to have their first log in to the app.
- Manage transactions: The student can view their past transactions in list or graph format, and filter them by date range. What's more, they can export the invoice or bill to the person they want.
- Peer-to-peer transfer: As long as 2 students have a valid student code, they can easily make a transfer to one another, with no additional cost.
- Integrate external banks: The student can add external banks as a financial source for the e-wallet, or withdraw the money back to the bank account.
- Make university payments: The student can pay for tuition fees, application fees, and dormitory fees directly within the app.
- Manage support requests: The student can send requests to the admin should they have any concerns relating to false transactions, or difficulties in using the app,...
- Manage account: The student has the right to view and modify some of their registered information, excluding name and student code.
